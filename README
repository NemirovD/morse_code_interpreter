## Morse Code Interpreter
A program that will interperet data made from the morse code generator (or any other set of data with similar format), and tell you which letter of the morse code alphabet is being repeated.

#### Usage

mCI &lt;Input FileName&gt;

#### File Format

The program will expect a file format where each line has two decimal numbers. The first being the time that the data was observed, and the second being the value of the data.

For the program to work the data MUST be centered around 1.

#### The Program

After reading in the data from the file the program will treat all values below 1 to be a zero signal and all values above one to be a 1 signal. The program assumes that the length of each dit and pause is 0.2 seconds long and the length of each dah will be twice that. If you have matlab installed the program will also open up matlab and plot the data for you. However this will only work on a windows pc.

##### The Makefile

The Makefile was designed to be used on windows systems and uses NMake to run it. Also the compiler uses cl.exe and link.exe to compile and link the objects respectively. These programs can be acquired by downloading installing Microsoft Visual Studio or the free version, Microsoft Visual Studio Express.

##### Additional Notes

The txt file, dumpdata.txt is a sample version of what the program would accept as input. It was generated by the Morse Code Generator.
